# Tinsta (Tiny Standard)
Tinsta theme aims to provide very standard web site layout with a lot of 
customization options. Anyway, it is not as rich of functions as Headway
or Divi, but is free, fast, not overbloated and... Open Source.

## Tinsta Explained

Tinsta provide a complete set of customization options right through
WordPress's Customizer tool.

## Why no complete customizeable ability like Headway
Because the theme's purpose is not to be a complete design builder, but
to provide a lot of customization options within the theme's scope.

## Why not layout builder like Site-Origin Panels, Divi, ..etc.
The theme is not intendet to be full featured like these commercial themes,
and at current stage cannot beat some big commercial solutions.
Anyway, there are a lot of plugins that provide layout builder for any theme, 
so you are free to use every plugin that you are familiar with.
You can try Site-Origin's Panels or Beaver Builder 

## Performance
The theme doesn't come with page cache and assets aggregation, it's just not theme's business to do that.
Instead you can consider [WP Super Cache](https://bg.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/) for page cache and [Autoptimize](https://bg.wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/)
for asset aggregation.

## Want to extend. Plugins recommendation list.
The theme cannot provide a replacement functions for everythink in WordPress's plugins garden,
and cannot make it better than other mature solutions. It's better to use some of the
listed plugins if they match your requirements and is not in the Tinsta's theme core.
